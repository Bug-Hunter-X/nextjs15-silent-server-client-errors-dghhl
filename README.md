# Next.js 15: Silent Errors in Server Components with Client-Side Rendering

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Next.js 15 related to error handling within server components when those components are also used for client-side rendering.  Errors occurring during asynchronous operations in server components may not be consistently caught and displayed on the client, resulting in silent failures or unexpected behavior.

## Problem

The core issue is that the error handling mechanisms designed for server components may not perfectly integrate with the client-side rendering context.  If an error occurs during an `async/await` call within a server component function used for both server and client rendering, the error might not be propagated correctly to the client, causing unpredictable rendering behavior.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the behavior when the `/api/data` endpoint experiences a failure (e.g., by simulating a network error).

## Solution

The recommended solution is to implement robust error boundaries within the server component and ensure that a proper fallback value or error state is explicitly managed and rendered on the client, even if the error isn't fully captured by Next.js's internal handling.

## Additional Notes

This issue highlights the importance of comprehensive error handling when building applications using Next.js 15's server components. By carefully designing error handling and providing user-friendly feedback, we can create more stable and robust applications.
